##In Jest, what are the differences between describe() and it() globals, and what are good uses for them?

Describe is used for grouping like-tests for readibility. It describes the intention of a specific test. It()s are nested inside describe()s.

##What is the point of Test Driven Development? What do you think about this approach?

To ensure the integrity of large applications over their lifecycles. Tests ensure that as an application is passed along developers, refactored, etc, that it continues to function without side effects and errors. I think this is good and necessary business practice.

##Mention three types of automated tests.

Unit testing, integration testing, and regression testing.
